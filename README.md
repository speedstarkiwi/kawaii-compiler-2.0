# kawaii-compiler 2.0

This is the **2.0** edition of **Kawaii** compiler. Explanation can be accessed in 1.0 also discord server: https://discord.gg/UmtdVUUvGw

# how does it work?

There is a specific function called `Luau::compile` which compiles lua scripts (code) into executable **bytecode**. After that, it uses `luau_load` to load and compile up the lua scripts.

# whats the difference?

This is *wayyyyyyy* better then 1.0 and also it was the first DLL I released without **skidding** after years.
